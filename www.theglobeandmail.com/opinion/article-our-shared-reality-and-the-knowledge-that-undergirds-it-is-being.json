Facts can evolve over time and we can seek to clarify them, but we can’t supplant them with something else and deem the something else to be facts on a par with actual facts. It was a matter of people working from commonly understood facts but having different opinions about what the appropriate response should be, then dialogue would be possible; however, there is no dialogue to be had when one side will not accept the facts and insists that their “something else” be given greater weight than the truth.",

They purported to represent \"truckers\", most of whom were vaccinated and moving freight. Their organization and funding was by those whose opposition to the government long preceded COVID.  There is plenty of work for drivers who wish to remain unvaccinated and stay north of the US/Canada border, so the very basis of their argument was unsupported. Their stated purpose was to replace the democratically elected government, and they absurdly proposed an interim government made up of themselves, the opposition parties and the GG. \nThe government has spent months patiently explaining the necessity of COVID protections, to little avail. One can only enter into productive, rational discussion with the rational, and little reason was expressed by the fear-mongering against vaccines nor the wild accusations of \"tyranny\" against the federal government. ",

If your group hates the government, or better, Justin Trudeau, the algorithms will find you and feed you all the necessary information. The same goes for those who oppose vaccines and so on. \nWhen I was growing up in the 50’s and 60’s many citizens thought and believed the purpose of government was to protect ourselves from ourselves. In 2022, apparently, the sitting government hasn’t fulfilled its mandate. Thanks to bots, overseas bad actors, our most impressionable, vulnerable citizens need education more than ever. These protests/ occupations were born out of ignorance and manufactured hatred. Nothing has changed. ",

What are the long term effects to the Immune system taking this new drug?\nThat's it, that was the whole enchilada.  Is it 100% safe and effective, absolutely not, if you say it is you've not researched or read near enough.  It absolutely looks like it did what it was meant to do, but, with this clinical trial being in its first 12 months there is no way to be sure.  We told the unvaxxed to stay home and we limited what they did, and, they for the most part did what they were told.  Now, as the numbers have gone down and we all wait for the next Strain the facts point to being vaccinated don't really affect society anymore, and, as more and more countries realize this our Federal govt not only refused to even talk but they doubled down with hate speech and some of the most disgusting language aimed at the very Citizens they are to serve.  So here we are.  I really like Andrew Coyne, I think he's the best writer in this country, I just disagree with him on this.  ",

It simply contains something that imitates the virus so that your system recognizes it as such and produces antibodies to fight it.That’s all. Period. As for the convoy, what reason would a government have to meet with its representatives when those representatives are demanding that they either give in to their minority demands or resign and for the GG to somehow intervene? Do you honestly think the majority of Canadians would have stood for that, especially after doing their part by following strict guidelines and getting vaccinated? The harshest language I heard was Trudeau calling them misinformed, which they were. I realize most of the protesters probably disagreed with the White Supremacists and neo-Nazis who joined their ranks, but they should have spent as much energy denouncing the presence of such people as they did expressing their discontent over mandates. Finally, the relaxation of restrictions in other countries was concurrent with the event and not part of the reason for it.",

But let's say we stick to covid and the perceived 'right think' vs 'wrong think', as Coyne has stated above. \n\nIn Canada, the 'right think' has stood by lockdown measures. Yet we have just seen one of the most extensive studies on lockdowns by John Hopkins that showed minimal benefit. Without measuring societal harms. \n\nThat 'right think' stood by vaccinating everyone multiple times. 'Wrong think' in Canada is questioning passports, mandates, and children receiving three vaccines. Yet, we have seen elected officials and CMOH across the country admit to the limitations of passports. Other western allies are not vaccinating children as young as 5. \n\nAre those 'wrong think' views than considered disinformation? ",

That reassures them and they have decided that since their new community approves of what they say, it is okay to be themselves.  And that is a person -- as we all are including myself-- of imperfect character.  In their case they have decided it is now okay to act on the fear and hate they have long felt towards others: Be those others gays, Jews, women, people who follow public health guidelines, or those who like to put little bows in the hair of their Yorkshire Terriers, whatever, it doesn't really matter.  This is what it looks like when people decide it is okay to slip the ties of civilized behavior.  The rules that should lead each of us to exercise self-control over the worst part of our characters.",

Of course people will go to non traditional sources when our media feeds us a mainly pro Trudeau or anti trucker stories..\n\nTo give credence to the idea that the cons are somehow responsible for the length of the protest is simply partisan. The motivation to stay was mainly derived from the liberals not dealing with their disgruntled citizens. In fact I would argue the conservatives efforts to speak with the protesters could have been used to have a more meaningful dialogue than from those who called them disgusting names\n\nUntil our news sources start reporting unbiased news the citizens will be frustrated to the point of protest, expect more. (FYI - I believe the protestors should have been moved after 5 days of course without the over reach of the EA.)",

Now that’s scary.\n\nI think that social media truly is toxic. Here in the GM comments section is the extent of my own participation in social media, and even this is pretty depressing sometimes.

In case you didn't notice seniors in long term care facilities died at very high rates in many countries including the US which was highly skeptical of WHO. \n\nWhile better mitigation of the virus in LTC homes could have occurred earlier on in the pandemic, very few countries were able to prevent the virus from entering LTC facilities.",

The science merely followed the evolving behaviour of the virus and its variants and with it the changing effectiveness of the vaccines. The health advisors merely stated the current understanding at given moments along the way, and with it their expectations. People who love to nurture distrust in the science also love to overlook this fact and sell the narrative that you are pushing here. Same thing when researchers express different positions in public. The disinformers latch on to anything they think might undermine the credibility of the experts and promote their own cynical, often conspiracy-laced narratives. Anyone who chooses disinformation over the best possible information at the time based on evolving science has a problem that no rational approach is going to solve.",

Because it would mean they would have to get vaccinated for employment or other activities. Therefore, they opposed vaccinations. Thus it is accurate to say they were \"anti-vax\"",

All knowledge not sanctioned by Brookie16 is evil and controlling. Not Brookie though. No sir. \n\nIts a very powerful “army” that is trying to “control” maybe even hurt people. Why? Because “people” (whom of course Brookie represents), don’t buy into their “controlling messages.”  Brookie was elected for this by “people.” \n\nBrookie pretends they are a contrarian and that we must protect, and appreciate our “contrarians”. In other words,  Psst listen to me, not to them.  Brookie can now write outrageous things and counsel horrible advice perhaps even violence against democracy, and the “government” and judges and police and universities and any civil institution we have that they hate. This lie is what drives freedumb. \n\nTruth and reality are complex. We and other democratic countries, decide with educated and informed citizens talking, discussing and finally voting for or against real things. ",

I described this previously as cynicism. It undermines agreed facts. It feeds conspiracy. \n\nWhat I didn’t see at first was the ruthless liars who would use this cynicism and feed it and mislead for financial and political gain. Trump and the GOP and it’s media outrage ecosystem are very far along this line often betraying the very people they claim they are supposed to help. \n\nAnd now it’s manifesting North of the border. The poison of cynicism combined with greed and a loss of faith in our institutions from a proud but cynical and ignorant group of people. Pity or outrage? Education? We need to do something. ",

Do you think that having a two-parent family in which the father is present is a highly useful entity in society for the production of sons who are more likely to be law-abiding than sons in families where a single mother does her best because the father left and abandoned his responsibilities to the kids? \n\nIs that phenomenon a shared reality for society? Plenty of foreign newspapers say it is, including columns in papers in Caribbean countries.\n\nIf that phenomenon, about the impact of fatherless families on the raising of boys, is a shared reality for society, do you think that our media have done a thorough job in exploring which racial/ethnic groups in Canada have had good success there and which racial/ethnic groups in Canada have high rates of challenge there?\n\nSeriously, do you think our big media players have shined a spotlight on that, so that as a society we can all have a \"shared reality\" about some of the social and law enforcement challenges in Canada?\n\nOr do you think that maybe, just maybe, our media are avoiding that subject like the plague, opting instead to push a conformist dogma that points accusations elsewhere?",

My post compared two defined groups, namely families in which a father had abandoned his children and family, resulting in a single mother raising the kids, versus families in which the father remained present. Those are two types of families and I compared the two. Contrary to your accusation, my post did not imply that those are the only two types of families in Canada and, contrary to your post's insinuated accusation, my post did not cast judgment on the effectiveness of other types of family structures. In any event, you need to read the scientific literature more: There are a great many studies on the specific subject of fatherless families resulting from abandonment (the subject of my post) and yes, fathers abandoning their families is associated with great injury and negative impact on the trajectories of the children involved.",

The truckers who occupied Ottawa accomplished very little in the political eyes of the nation's people. The truckers themselves looked like bums in the street - yet truly don't care what what they show to others in the country. Loud, obnoxious behaviour ain't a tool for success nor winning sympathy and support. Especially among the federal government workers in Ottawa. I am sure that the dogma and rhetoric from those parading around Ottawa thrilled their supporters at home - but disgusted the rest of the nation..These truckers had a legitimate demonstration, and then hung around town, harassing locals and seeming to be drunkards for weeks. It thrilled their own supporters, who are now proud of that time in Canadian history. During media interviews with truckers, we usually heard monosyllabic words in badly structured sentences.\nIf 90% of truckers have had their \"shots\" due to Covid. Why did this other 10% demand so much attention? Political desperation - with their ignorance jumping to the fore. And their political table includes far more than just Covid.\n",

I am not talking about mistakes, I am talking about systemic bias that causes them to support causes they like and dismiss or attempt to cancel  causes they disagree with. People are not stupid. When these three institutions reveal their bias and debase themselves then for some folks they tend to lose credibility. Now come an important issue like vaccine mandates and public safety and members of these institutions are furious that people mistrust them?

However, like a lot of posters on these forums, he usually gives thoughtful and informed opinions on topics.\n\nSure, he has far more faith on traditional media who follow actual journalistic practices and standards to present the news of the day to us. That doesn't suggest there is no bias or perspective.\n\nHowever, I will take that approach over a very cynical, lets dismiss anything written or said about a topic because there is perceived bias.  Several months ago, you were posting almost daily comments to that effect about articles here in the Globe.

But really, are the people who protested misinformed. There was a whole long article in this paper that laid out the facts, yet we have writers that continue to push this false narrative. Bottom line, other countries are done with this and soon we will be as well, no matter the case count. It is just sad that we have turned on each other like this, as a fully vaxxed person who has had covid, shouldn't we respect others rights to choose especially considering all of this will go away soon.",

Wouldn't that have resulted in even more people getting vaccinated?\n\nThe reason for the truckers mandate was that generally throughout the pandemic, the Canada and US governments have tried to have consistent policies related to cross border travel. This has been done because both governments understood it was important for keeping the economies moving.\n\nWhy is that so hard to understand or accept?\n\n\n",

Some, conservatives, sure, a small minority. The vast majority, no way.\n\nSecond, for all your pontificating on the truckers - or the \"hostage takers\" as you labelled them - did you actually go out and speak to these people? No, I didn't think so. Instead, you sowed division with an opinion piece written from home instead of engaging in real journalism.\n\nWith this column above, while some truckers do appear loopy, you again denigrate the entire group with a broad brush. Remember, these people were able to travel to/from the US without a vaxx for two years. And as for the science for which they are skeptical, you should be asking yourself: what role did media play on issues related to efficacy of masks, the lab leak theory, natural immunity, etc. \n\nIn short, opinion writers for the G&M are part of the problem in creating a shared reality, not the solution.\n\nTriple Vaxxed Al\n",

We are going to get back to normal in the next few months regardless of case count. Just sad how we turned on each other so quick, instead of listening and respecting others decisions we vilified and attacked. All over a vaccine and a virus that isn't that deadly.

Dozens of trading posts were trading whiskey for bison hides. First Nations were slaughtering bison just for the hide.\n\nWolf hunters in the Cypress Hills near the Alberta Sask border were poisoning bison carcasses to kill wolves that fed on the carcasses. They thought that some First Nations had stolen some horses, so they slaughtered a number of indigenous people. \n\nPM John A MacDonald formed the NWP to stop the whiskey traders. The first target of the NWMP was the whiskey Post called Fort Whoop Up near present day Lethbridge \n\nWoke folk do not like Our shared reality and attempt to re-write our history.  Fort Walsh in the Cypress Hills & Fort MacLeod in southern Alberta are reality.

Science travels down many roads and  it's the nature of scientific progress that many of those roads lead no where.  \n\nSome of our most famous scientists have had the oddest of notions.

Even though we've had thirty-plus years of failed end-of-world predictions, this debate is closed? (And before the dogpile starts, I'm referring to the end-of-world, \"if we do nothing we're all DEAD!\" severity predictions, not the fact of a changing climate)\n\nAnd if that debate is closed, why isn't the debate on centrally-planned socialism versus free-market capitalism closed as well? With that topic we have 100 years of proof that central planning doesn't work.\n\nAnd combining those two, why are we are attempting to centrally-plan (with bans and caps and taxes) our response to end-of-world climate change?\n\nWell, only Western countries are. All other countries, including the world's largest emitter, China, are just handed a free pass.\n\nI didn't realize it until I wrote the above paragraph, but: are debates only \"closed\" when a solution that harms Western economies is found?",

Incidentally Mr. Peckford has a case before the Supreme Court WRT to these violations. My point is to disinformation.\"\n\n1. Brian Peckford was not a signatory of the Charter.  The Constitution Act, 1982 (which contains it) was signed by 4 people: Queen Elizabeth, PM Pierre Trudeau, AG Jean Chretien, and Registrar General André Ouellet.  \n\n2. As to his input into the Charter, a constitutional scholar who took part in the negotiations  had this to say:\n\n\"I also find Mr. Peckford’s approach to be self-serving. His own role, in my opinion, was relatively minor. [. . .] If you read my description of the discussions in Premier Blakeney’s suite that night you will find that Premier Peckford contributed very little to what had already been agreed to by senior officials.\"\n\n3. He is a nominal plaintiff in a case in the Federal Court Trial Division (not the Supreme Court) about covid travel rules.  His own lawyer is not arguing Mr. Peckford's somewhat bizarre interpretation of the Charter.",

So to simply claim, as you do, that various 'mandates' violate our rights is meaningless  -  the question is whether any 'violations' (or, more to the point, limits) are reasonable.\n\nWho decides if limits are reasonable? The courts, not Team Peterbilt. In fact, the Charter very specifically says, in Section 24:  \n\n(1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.\n\n\nYou might then read the rest of the Charter. You'll find (I've dealt with this 'talking point' before) that it does not include a right to 'seek a livelihood'. It does include a right 'to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province'. But that's section 6 of the Charter, titled 'mobility rights'. It's the 'in any province' part that's the important bit. \n\nHere you are, decrying misinformation, yet your post is full of it.",

The continued attempt to portray the protests as \"peaceful\". Blockades of borders and cities for any length of time greater than a few hours is not a legal protest, no matter the cause. \n\nThe majority of Canadians want mandates to end when it makes sense. Restrictions were ending. Governments were reacting to Omicron changing the landscape of what works and what doesn't. The system was working. \n\nPeel back the layers on most who say they are anti-mandate and you'll find an anti-vaxxer and covid denier. Very few are truly about the personal freedom angle. The use of words like \"tyranny\", \"dictatorship\" and comparisons to China and Nazi Germany are absolutely ridiculous. The hate on Trudeau is ridiculous.

Who benefits when society is thrown into a chaotic state? Who benefits when families are divided over what used to be simple medical procedures? There is intent behind this and it needs to be rooted out and exposed.",

On the other end of the spectrum, you have the possibility that it is like Russia's interference in the U.S. election, using social media platforms to stoke discord to destabilize our politics.

Perhaps I am splitting hairs but it's something like why some people take drugs temporarily for pain but stop the usage after the injury has healed, or take them recreationally occasionally, but don't get hooked, and others take them once and then again and again until they are a basket case. My unscientific analysis of this is bolstered by the examples of the few people I know who are covid-19 skeptics and oppose restrictions, harbour and have expressed in the past opinions about minorities and government that could not be described as either enlightened or educated, to put it diplomatically.  They found something that suited their worldview and wrapped both arms around it.",

Media should present the facts so we can understand and debate these things. Readers must have the critical faculty to separate propaganda from good reporting and that is what is missing I think. Unless you've had a high-quality education and some post-secondary learning the nuance is completely lost and people hear only what they want to hear.",

I know it's supposed to be true. Here's someone who says no such thing, it's all intelligent design\". \"How sure am I in my own views?\" Don't take refuge in the false security of consensus and the feeling that whatever you think you're bound to be okay because you're in the safely moral majority.\n\n-- Christopher Hitchens on freedom of speech, Hart House, University of Toronto, 2007",

Each behaves and is motivated by quite different forces for quite different reasons.\n\nGalileo was indicted for 'spreading misinformation' in his time.  \n\nBut since - after having been admonished by this Holy Office entirely to abandon the false opinion that the Sun is the centre of the world and immoveable, and that the Earth is not the centre of the same and that it moves, and that I must not hold, defend, nor teach in any manner whatever, either orally or in writing, the said false doctrine, and after it had been notified to me that the said doctrine was contrary to Holy Writ - I wrote and caused to be printed a book in which I treat of the said already condemned doctrine, and bring forward arguments of much efficacy in its favour, without arriving at any solution: I have been pronounced to be under vehement suspicion of heresy, that is, of having held and believed that the Sun is the centre of the world and immoveable, and that the Earth is not the centre and moves.\n\nhttps://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1630galileo.asp\n\nBe careful what you wish for.",

So clearly so that late-American Presidents would have wanted him to be locked up for treason. Especially someone like Republican President General Dwight D. Eisenhower - who led the USA at the height of the Cold War. Trump's millions of worshipers also praise Putin, the leader of a country that is still the USA's primary military adversary.\nJustin Trudeau ain't very smart, and I think that this disaster with the truckers' occupation of downtown Ottawa may lead him to depart politics. If he does, Christa Freeland would likely win a leadership race and be far stronger than him politically and intellectually on the campaign trail. And IF Pierre P. is the Tories new leader, election victory will be impossible for the Conservative Party (even against Trudeau).\n",

His obnoxious American-like approach won't be warmed to by middle-ground voters in Canada - who are the KEY to election victory. As they were for Stephen Harper's victories when party leader. The current mindset of the Tories and their rabid supporters ensures that the party will do worse than it did with O'Toole as their leader. I concede that there are tens of thousands in Alberta and elsewhere who would be thrilled by Saint Pierre's loud-mouth approach to things.

I would perhaps add the loss of regard for community and the common good, with the increased emphasis on meism, and individualism.\nPeople may remember the community backbone of the Prairies, the COOPS, Alberta Pool, Sask Pool, Manitoba Elevators. That was helping neighbours. Now the community is online, little social contact (brought on by a real viral pandemic).\nI fear the power of social media. Hopefully our schools are teaching critical thinking, but that capacity seems lost on great numbers of our fellow Canadians.\nI also fear the knowledge vaccum sucking up US propaganda. How is it that people are \"pleading the 5th\"? What business is it of Cruz and Trump Jr. and the many other Americans who contributed to find raising?\nHow different is that from the Russian Bots in the US election.\nI am worried.\n\n",

The consumer is left to their own devices to determine whether the source is legitimate.\n\nProtecting the vulnerable, the ongoing capacity of essential health services; mitigating climate change (as in wildfires, flooding, extreme temperatures and weather events, ice storms, drought), and striving towards sustainability (as in sustenance) are insidious objectives.

The source is unchecked social media and portions of our traditional media (disproportionately in the U.S. but also in Canada) whose goals have changed from providing their audience with fair and balanced programming to one of promoting anything that drives profit. The profit is achieved by emphasizing divisive and conspiracy-based “opinion” programming that drives ratings as well as through algorithms that promote conspiracy-based arguments and hate-driven content on social media and internet-based platforms. Governments have neglected to take the measures necessary to protect truth and honesty in public discourse and basic civility within our greater media environment. \r \r Until we (through our governments) find a way to mitigate the lies and hate-driven content that is currently pervasive throughout well-established social media platforms and conventional television and radio platforms the ability of our society to work towards common goals in a healthy and constructive manner will be increasingly and perhaps irrevocably threatened. \rSociety needs to thoughtfully \"curate\" content not censor it. At one time we did just that. ",

I suppose it began nobly enough to liberate us common folk from the superstitions of the past (including the superstitions that made whole nations, at the “peak” of civilization, vulnerable to manipulation and led to enormous suffering in the 20th century).  \n\nEach side in the vax debate claims the other suffers from a failure to apply their reason to a problem. Yet it’s not an exercise in reason that is called for. Few of us are able to assess by “thinking for ourselves” the efficacy or safety of vaccines or the cost-benefit vs COVID. What is required is epistemic trust. The vaccinated, at some level, put their trust in socially-created knowledge - they trust some of their compatriots, and people in other lands, who have acquired knowledge by study and give their blessing to vaccination. The anti-vax people say these people are too trusting and should “think for themselves” “do their own research”. \n\nThere must be a restoration of social and epistemic trust before there can be any effort to get people to “think for themselves”. ",

Another government decision is the $40 billion payout to FN’s over the child welfare situation! That is taxpayers money! Where is the accountability? Why will the press not do their job and question the government how they arrived at such an obscene settlement?????\n\nThe press blames the people, but the PEOPLE GET THEIR INFORMATION FROM THE PRESS. \n\nCoyne can blame the darkest parts of the Internet all he wants, but the problem primarily lies with the mainstream press, not the lunatic fringe. ",

The perfect example was Trudeau’s trip to India ~ Canadian media characterized it as a triumph in the beginning whereas Indian media reported it as the farce that it was. Indian press reports started to travel around the world and was picked up by American right wing media. Canadian media noticed they were out of sync with the global media but still thought Trudeau was still being triumphant and finally we were told by MSM the costume party was a disaster.\nSimilarly, the global view of the Convoy is largely at odds with the characterization of the Canadian media…the NYT’s reported arrests “at gunpoint” ;Canadian media declared it misinformation until the photos emerged of assault rifles being pointed into an occupied trailer. Similarly the global reaction to freezing accounts without due process I believe has lead the government to reverse blocking accounts yesterday.  Coyne’s article is more about the inability to shape public opinion which was once within the power of the MSM",

Andrew cautioned when they were declared we needed to step back before coming to a conclusion and have more information.\n\nI am still in the midst of gaining insight into what could and could not be done with the two declarations of emergency and on balance do not have enough insight on law and police enforcement to argue against them.\n\nOne person seems to be missing in many people's lives and that an excellent General Physician who you know and they know you and you trust their advice on health issues. I have had an excellent GP for more than 30 years and they certainly encourage me to get vaccinated and I trust their advice rather than those on FaceBook.",

It's stunning that there was no contingency plan for a city that houses our federal government. And that's after a fella went through the halls of government buildings with a gun some years ago. \n\nAt the beginning of the convoy, our PM ran and hid. Without any leadership at the federal level, and no action being taken (other than classic finger pointing) at other levels, the convoy simply rolled into the city and parked. And stayed. Suddenly, after the media asked where the leaders were, things began to change. Too late.\n\nWhen you have a situation building without leadership, you can just see the players capitalizing on the gaps and weaknesses of those who should be protecting us. That is the alarming equation: bad leadership + bad data + bad players + bad behaviour = bad outcomes. \n\nLeadership. First.",

The majority of people who stood on the side of the road and applauded the convoy on their way to Ottawa were simply displaying their frustration with vaccine mandates - remember that's what started this thing off. These are not stupid people, they have looked at facts and determined that vaccines are good but enforcing tests at borders have zero benefit when Omicron is already here. They don't like the hypocrisy of government after praising truckers for 2 years then enforcing a mandate that has zero benefit to public health. The media in Canada, especially the G&M and the CBC portray everyone who had any sympathy for the original convoy as someone who is either loopy or racist. Yet there are many reasonably, educated people and some Provincial leaders who see it's time to peel back the restrictions yet the Federal government sticks to it's authoritarian mandates. ",

What I saw was friendly and decent people speaking French, English, young and old, male and female, and of all different races. The mainstream media turned ALL of these people into one very distorted and ugly 'enemy of the state' and collectively dismissed them all as stupid criminals. Media and politicians cherry picked from the crowd the really poor examples they wanted and focused exclusively on this tiny minority in order to discredit everyone involved. How convenient to discredit and dismiss them all as 'flat-earthers' rather than acknowledge that the protestors included decent Canadians with legitimate concerns. The media followed and even enabled the government script, and that script did not in any way reflect what I could see was really happening. Media and politicians' credibility is very poor at best, and it is politicized and designed to create conflict, intolerance, and to silence differing views. At least YouTube allows me to see what is real, rather than the media's one-sided, divisive script.",

But how do you chastise the general public for misinformation when those at the top, those that hold the authority within our society, misuse it repeatedly for political or monetary gain.\n\nYou cannot penalize people for what they believe or don’t believe, but you can educate them to hopefully make good choices. More importantly, you can hold those to account who deliberately lie.\n\nWhat is oftentimes equally as important as to what is said is what is not said, perhaps deliberately omitted. For example, in your closing paragraph you refer to the Conservative’s support of the protest and it’s impact on the prospective length of the protest. Yet you deliberately omitted the inflaming remarks of the PM to the protestors. Many could easily argue that too could have prolonged the protest and made it worse.\n\nI think we can agree that the media has played a certain role in this age of disinformation, this “combined assault on reality”.\n\n\n",

These are people who appear to have detached themselves not only from the behavioural norms of civil society.\"   What we have been experiencing, both in Canada, and in other parts of the world is a breakdown in trust of the knowledge brokers. Too much gotcha politics stories. Too little evidence, too much spin.  Too much demonizing of enemies, too little seeking of common ground.  Long on narrative manipulation and short on evidence and insight. It is too easy to blame this all on social media.  Rebuilding that trust will need a lot of work.  But its an essential part of a healthy democracy.\n",

But not having the cover of the federal party categorical condemnation of these criminals, Doug continued to dither.\n\nHow much comfort did the occupiers take from their enablers online, as quick to minimize their misconduct (“peaceful protest”) as to exaggerate their mistreatment (“police brutality”)?\n\nGreat comfort. That is why the echo chamber needs to be knee caped financially. The funds frozen thus far ought not be released until after applications are made to the courts (independent of the authorities) to permananetly remove from the hands of violent insurrectionists.\n\nHow healthy can our democracy remain, under this combined assault on reality?\n\nNot healthy at all.

Worse still, they used these rubes to gaslight democracy because they know in a true democracy their priorities would never see the light of day. \nThe hard truth is the vast majority of Canadians don't believe that the individual rights of a few should TRUMP the rights of the majority of Canadians and because of that the CPC declared war on the rest of Canada. The real issue isn't disinformation, but rather the leaders who knowingly propagate, mobilize and legitimize it to advance their own nefarious agenda. The senior leadership of the CPC needs to be fully investigated by the CPC in terms of their role on this assault on our democracy. Had they not legitimized and assisted the organizers it this would have only lasted a few days, if that.",

There were detractors:\n\n\"Specifically one of the reasons cited by interveners for such an approach give the Commission sufficient cause for concern that there would be abusive comment or abusive pictorial representation in the programming broadcast by Fox News that, when taken in context,tends to or is likely to expose an individual or group or class of individuals to hatred or contempt on the basis of race,national or ethnic origin,colour,religion,sex,sexual orientation,age or mental or physical disability. Accordingly,the Commission will not impose any requirement on BDUs for the distribution of Fox News other than those that generally apply with respect to the carriage of non-Canadian services that are included on the digital lists. - article 38: https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2004/pb2004-88.htm\n\nTimes have changed - FoxNews is pushing disinformation which does not comply with our content regulations. It's a clear case of abusive content and extreme political bias. It's unacceptable.\n\n",

The people I have spoken to who chose not to get the shots are decent and intelligent people who have their own valid reasons (scientific, faith or otherwise) for their personal health decisions. There are pros and cons to the vaccines, and it is too early yet to know all of these. No one wants to hear this - we are intolerant. Coyne's own words are at the root of the problem. Dismissal and disrespect of people who are 'different' is how the politicians, media and public have approached this. These millions of people were all lumped together as one imaginary foe, dismissed as stupid, a threat, or worse and widely and openly despised for their (different) choice, the majority calling for their banishment and punishment. As a society we have become intolerant. It is inherent for people to despise and bully those who are different. We are starting to deal with this 'group-think' tendency in the areas of racism and sexism, but it remains inherent. The vaccine mandates allowed people to vent their intolerance of 'different' on a new class, the unvaxxed, and boy did people get on board with that. \n",

The meeting could have been held at a safe location to protect his safety. It could have been covered by the news media.\n\nI expect the protest leaders would have said various things that our Prime Minister could then have easily shown to be nonsense. For example if protest leader stated that Trudeau was breaching their first amendment rights he could have responded that they are not living in the USA andthat maybe they are watching too much fake new on the Fox Network. I don't think any of their arguments would have been very difficult to defeat.\n\nI think it might have helped to make some of the protestors wake up and realise they had been duped by their leaders. \n",

It started with the Conservatives under Harper and spread its contagion throughout the other parties. People picked that up and amplified it. The continued disrespect for the governing Liberals despite election wins has eroded trust in our institutions and generated hate. Just look at any headline in the National Post or the SUN to prove my point. ",

The question of how to resolve this is important, much of this push against knowledge is deliberate and it's well embedded in the cable \"news\", online \"press\", \"social\" media. Suppression would be impossible and would just be censorship, a bad direction for all.\n\nI hope that recent events will politicize people across Canada. First, to insist that their representatives stop stoking this fire. I hope it will move Canadians to fully participate in our democracy. Run for office; insist that candidates are serious about democracy rather than partisanship, only vote for a party with actual policy platforms; support your local candidate; write letters to hold your MPs accountable. Vote. Forty percent of eligible Canadians did not vote in 2021. Vote.",

The assault on knowledge and truth has been around for years, mainly a left wing academic phenomenon known as post structuralism; an off shoot of Marxism. This group argues that beliefs and knowledge are manufactured to maintain the hegemony (Gramsci) of the dominant economic elite. What we have now is an adaptation of that theory by the populist right. No surprise that in many ways the left and right continue to challenge and threaten the center..",

No emergency or special powers required. If you do notice you will tell yourself that the new law doesn’t apply to me, only bad people, so no concern. And you will do it without ever noticing that the government just took a little more control of your choices. And you just lost a little more of your freedom.",

Social media has gobbled up the advertising dollars that supported hard news gathering and made access to it really affordable, and social media is an attractive, addictive, fact-free substitute for reading hard news and analysis.\n\nThe market is at work and it is putting the people who stand between us and a fact-free society out of business, or forcing them to work for specialized industry services or take an interest in things like lifestyle writing or product reviews. Policymakers try things to stave off this meltdown and what do you know, those policies become the target of more disinformation and conspiracy thinking about the policy itself. We are risking a future where professionals, specialists and rich people have access to hard information through expensive, tailored services and everyone else is \"doing their own research\", with predictable results, and that will reinforce social divisions. ",

In the spirit of trying to be constructive, it might be useful for at least some social media forms (newspaper comments, twitter, etc) to make everyone's comment history publicly viewable. When you debate things in real life with a person over time, you have the opportunity to see their views change (or hold them to account if they contradict themselves). Social media makes this much harder. Anyway just a thought; there may be some simple ways to improve the situation given that large scale ones seem to be impossible or go unheeded. ",

Let’s start with the 30% or so support or the protesters from the larger public; since 90% of the public are vaccinated, we cannot label those supporting as ill informed. Ditto for the politicians. And it is not a compelling argument to explain motivations by calling people liars and so on.  Moreover, a one-dimensional categorization of persons, as with 'knowledge' here, is bound to distort and lack empathy. I accept many of the unvaccinated are ill-informed, but this is not what lit the fuse of anger to bring people to Ottawa. It was the PM stepping on the truckers; using the category of ‘knowledge’ to label the vaccine hesitant as unacceptable, and then the mandates to attack their dignity and threaten their livelihood. It was this abuse of power that disturbed the democracy. It was empathy for little people being stepped on that swelled their support.",

If not the academics, the media, the politicians, the public sector, the judicial system or the corporate elite, then who is left to challenge the government narrative? When the government even chooses to use the nuclear option of martial law to snuff out grass root resistance then you know that our country is in a very bad place that is close to hopeless.\n",

Wokeism and Political Correctness - and Cancel Culture - largely imported from the USA - are undermining schools, universities, the media, and human resources departments. As a friend of mine said today, \"Reasonableness is caught between the Utterly Crazy Vicious Left and the Viciously Irrational Paranoid Right.\" The center will hold, one hopes, but it is not going to be easy. ",

Sadly there are those who cannot smell the lies and understand the motive of those lies or perhaps the liars are just getting better or that we collectively are becoming lazier. We are certainly living in a post modern, post literary world where facts become handmaiden not of the truth but of political machination. We all need to step back and breath. Concentrate on the many positives of our country. Originally I was furious that these people invaded our capital, stomped on our memorials and insulted our leadership . I am still red about it, but it occurred to me that they should be pitied. To risk their economic well being, social standing, employment opportunities, their children's education for a failed understanding of civics carrying half baked conspiracy theories is really sad. I am glad now that the police forces and levels of  government tread lightly and patiently on them. Obviously these people need some real help.   ",

They, the creators, have bowed down before their creations. Let us liberate them from the chimeras, the ideas, dogmas, imaginary beings under the yoke of which they are pining away. Let us revolt against the rule of thoughts. Let us teach men, says one, to exchange these imaginations for thoughts which correspond to the essence of man; says the second, to take up a critical attitude to them; says the third, to knock them out of their heads; and — existing reality will collapse.\"\n\nOr maybe not. ",

It's inescapable, and reporters and journalists are just as prone to bias as the rest of us.\n\nHowever, well-trained, experienced reporters are aware--or at least try to be aware--of their biases and inclinations, and they acknowledge them and attempt to compensate for them when necessary. Some are better at this than others. In a well-run news outlet, experienced, capable and wise editorial oversight consistently encourages that awareness and helps cultivate that compensation.\n\n\n",

And the misinformation is being spread by such supposedly reputable news media as the New York Times that published today yet another erroneous account of what had gone down in Ottawa stating that the police had used tear gas on the protesters and that mass arrests had been made when only pepper spray had been used at one point because the protesters had become too aggressive with the police and under 200 people over the course of three days had been arrested and most of them released without charges except of course the organizers. Mr. Coyne’s article underscores the failings of our educational systems throughout Canada to teach civics classes and critical thinking. As far as our neighbours to the south are concerned, the New York Times and Fox TV themselves need to educate themselves about Canada before commenting on us. The NYT in another article thought our head of government was a president!",

They just no longer care.\"\n\nThis paragraph could very easily describe the Trudeau/Butts government. Think back to SNC Lavalin and how the Prime Minister lied his way through as the story unravelled or how certain members of the media simply don't report things or diminish the significance because it doesn't fit the narrative. I won't even mention the optics of the $600 million bribe. Sorry Mr Coyne, if the media was an objective mirror of the news (think Christie Blatchford) and not a cheerleader for whatever the PMO needs (think Gary Mason, Rosemary Barton or Laurence Martin) then people might turn to the mainstream media for information instead of searching elsewhere.

Explaining to Canadians and other journalists how losing 2 prominent female cabinet ministers not for their own maleficence but due to the PM's direction of an attempt to influence the Attorney General of Canada in a criminal case and the resignation of the Clerk of the Privy Council and the PM's Principal Secretary was not only serious but historically the worst thing that has ever happened in Canada. Go back and look a the At Issue segments from that time period.\nThe CBC especially may have given SNC a soft peddle at the beginning and Justin the benefit of the doubt too often but they didn't hold back once the truth was exposed.\n",

Despite his friends trying to talk him down from the ledge and reason with him, he became even more passionate against the vaccines and the mandates. Despite losing most of his friends he went deeper into the abyss actually traveling several hours to go to a diner that was not enforcing health restrictions and constantly posting on FB about it. He became obsessive and maniacal about every pandemic restriction and the vaccines because he 'did his research', posting the nonsense on-line for everyone to see his obsession. He is a successful businessman but is absolutely consumed by the pandemic restrictions and has become basically delusional.\nAs someone who is university educated, taught critical thinking skills and consume information from several different sources on every side of an issue, this type of confirmation bias and rejection of knowledge and truth is hard for me to get my head around but the pandemic has exposed those that are susceptible and it is scary to see it happen to someone you know.\n",

They simply need to comply.\n\nDemocracy works best when citizens put some thought into what sort of society they want and which party best reflects that vision. Then they need to act: by voting for and perhaps even funding their preferred party.\n\nTranscending the tangle of partisan preferences & processes, however, must be an appreciation of the need for social order and the institutions that contribute to that order: legislators, courts and police, all of whom are advised, supported & trained by experts in our educational institutions, etc.",

These individuals have reneged on their commitment to serve our nation. After being trained and salaried by us, their fellow citizens, they then turned their unique expertise against us.\n\nSurely even they recognize the value of social order. \nWhile they were delighting in their ability to torment Windsor workers and ordinary families across Ottawa, their parents & grandparents were enjoying the benefits of the very social order that they helped to create, but which these ill-informed, manipulated mobs were determined to undo.\n\nThe only veterans I knew well were three from WWII: my mom's older brother and my parents-in-law.\nThey served to preserve social order & democracy, not anarchy-as-\"Freedom.\"",

Whatever our laws, whatever our rules they must change to be more responsive and our institutions must be better informed of threats.\n\nOther than kicks and anger, my only thought is that those who are really behind this are trying to collapse the economy and buy it for cheap when everything crashes.\n\nThe worst part for me is that nobody looked in the trucks. There could have been anything in there. They are taking advantage of our rights and freedoms based society to trash it while they wear the flag and talk about freedom. We can't continue as we are and hope to combat this.\n\nThe best articulation of the problem for me is that these are the people who will refuse to take a vaccine, but will consume thousands of dollars of medicine, including IV medicine, and hospital care should they become ill, thereby limiting other's access to care. In my opinion this should never have been allowed to happen from the get go. They cause all this harm that costs millions, probably billions of dollars but are never, ever held accountable.  This really needs to change.\n",

Yet those of us who can see the mainstream media misrepresent events that we can see with our eyes are belittled and denigrated.\n\nIf the G&M wishes to be upfront, my question would be how much of the Liberal's $600 million handout to legacy media ended up in its bank account?\n",

Earlier this month, in response to BB's article on the Windsor blockade, a commenter posted a link to a video that he said showed brutal tactics being used by \"Turdeau's\" goons against these peaceful truckers.\n\nThe brief (20 seconds?), rather grainy video showed multiple grey, multi-storey buildings lining the street... nothing like the highway scenes that we were seeing.\nThe armoured, club-swinging officers were certainly acting brutally. But they looked nothing like the officers that we saw in Windsor.\n\nLast week another BB commenter said that he'd see a video of armed police beating an opposition MP inside the House of Commons, \"filmed surreptitiously by a Conservative MP.\"\nWhen another commenter asked for the link, the first guy said that it had just been deleted, further proof of Trudeau's fascist grip on the media.",

It was thought that shortly after it’s introduction that it caused cardio vascular adverse events. What was determined by subsequent independent researchers was that because of its very positive profile, it was being “preferentially prescribed” to the worst case patients (many more of which had pre-existing heart conditions). So it appeared that it could aggravate heart problems more than other NSAIDS, but in reality, all NSAIDS can aggravate pre-existing heart conditions if they were prescribed to these patients as much as Vioxx was. Check the labelling of most NSAIDS these days and you’ll see that they all contain warnings to use caution when using in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. That’s the positive outcome of the Vioxx experience. It exposed the negative CV effects of all NSAIDS so they could all be used more safely. Vioxx was never re-introduced because of all the money needed to fight pending lawsuits until the truth was known. Bit, it is back on the market now for different uses.",

Daintily, even.\n\nI would suggest that this inability to say out loud and clearly what is going on is a big part of the problem. Coyne has a large soapbox and he is paid well to stand on it.\n\nYet not a mention of the MOU and its contents (well known *before* Conservative senators and MPs and interim leader coddled and encouraged the occupation. No delving into the easy to discover backgrounds and associations of the organizers. No mention of the actual meaning of many of the symbols that were flown proudly by the occupiers on a daily basis.\n\nCourage and clarity are needed. And they are needed now, before a lot more people start believing this was \"just a peaceful protest.\"\n\n\n",

The premier here is angry, partisan, divisive and devoid of facts. But he keeps peddling blatant mistruths and the people buy it because they like being angry, rude, and to be frank, dumb.  He's the leader of a gang, not a government. As long as you're rah rah sports and talk like a hick, a fencepost could be elected here.\n\nWe've reached the point where the facts simply don't matter to a certain segment of the population. And it's turned the bullies loose. Waiting 3 weeks to quell this was the worst possible thing that could have happened. The second was letting so many of them go without charges. We will be paying for this failure for decades to come. It's time to get it together, because they won't stop.\n\n\n",

(No, not a plot, but it would not be the first cultural trend to be imported from the south.) This is not a phenomenon that just happened. It serves the purpose of the US billionaire donor class whose grasping is boundless. America is not in a frenzy about the fake moon landing or space aliens. What gains traction is what gets in the gears of running a normal government: \"Democrat\" pedophile rings. \"Democratic\" election stealing. \"Democrat\" suppression of white people. \"Democrat\" open borders. As that great tool of the oligarchy put it, \"We've got to always be flooding the zone with sh*t.\" They have gone beyond trying to get people to believe tax cuts for the rich are for them to suffocating the idea of rational thinking entirely. This is less Germany 1933 and more Italy 410. And the point of all this is money and power.",

When you have a government that's gleefully in bed with the CCP so much so that they're willing to risk their own population's health on a Chinese vaccine, you have to wonder if they even have Canadian's interests at heart. And then they tried to back pedal taking vaccines from a program that was meant for developing countries. In the end, vaccines for Canadians were late. \nAnd then you have Catherine McKenna stating to her liberal buddies on youtube that if you tell a lie loud enough in the House of Commons, it becomes true! Honestly, if politicians are playing the truth game, is it no wonder people want to dig deeper to find their own truth?  \nhttps://youtu.be/WwN482nnga0\nTrust goes hand in hand with truth which this government seems to have a hard time understanding. Either you tell the truth in the real world, or you're a fraud.",

Such behaviour is indeed scandalous and harmful in multiple ways, but it is exposed as such and condemned by most citizens including Liberal supporters. It is not in the same league as disinformation that targets what Coyne calls the repositories of knowledge: universities, courts and media. To that list we could add our leading research bodies on public health and climatology.\n\nBelow, Jtractor asks us to \"please start looking at the evidence supporting Climate Change.\"\nThis is exactly what Coyne is referring to: what happened to our trust, our deference to trained people with expertise that we lack?\n\nJtractor encourages us to, as Coyne puts it, \"attempt to make sense of the world unaided\", the assumption being that the evidence that we find online will be accurate, current & peer reviewed.",

Like our response to Axis expansionism during WWII, these problems require sustained, concerted action on the part of citizens. One would think that both problems are as obvious a threat to us as Nazism was to our parents a lifetime ago. \n\nTheir response to Nazism seems impossible today: the internet would be alive with arguments that the threat is manufactured by power-seeking elites, that only sheeple go to war, that Big Business profits from war, etc.",

Solving this with the burden of free speech requires careful thought for adjustment and our political leadership appears unable to address this challenge. ANDRE CLEMENT",

A childhood spent being too smart for support in school but not smart enough to qualify for extra assistance to ensure their success is a recipe for creating an adult who is unprepared to manage the barrage of disinformation out there. And it certainly builds bitterness towards the system and those who are able to succeed within it. \n\nChildren who have difficulty grasping concepts, and who struggle academically, are made to feel less worthy and hopeless. I do not think we can underscore the impact it has on an individual to spend your entire childhood feeling left behind. \n\nEnsuring the well being and success of each child within our schools system so they come out prepared for a world full of disinformation, and who feel they have a meaningful role to play within society would go a long way to eliminate class struggle.\n",

Unfortunately, too many people are pre-disposed to an easy way forward. False dichotomies are easy to explain; and apparently easily believed... it's just that either/or dichotomies are not the solutions in civil society.

That is simple common sense when we agreed same sex marriage was a good thing. I will point out only a few examples of what a person could see as \"dis\" or \"misinformation\". Leap forward to the current day where we are told a person can change gender simply by declaring it. Not only that, but the gender fluid may switch back and forth even minute by minute and questioning this makes one \"phobic\" while erroneously misgendering them can get you fired or worse! There are also 200 over genders and if you look them up good luck finding coherent definitions. Next, how in the hell can anyone espouse Marxism in any form has been beneficial in it's history, it is a proven failed dogma that inevitably kills millions when/wherever launched. Finally I give you \"mostly peaceful\" protests that caused a billion in damage and saw 25 people killed. These are a mere few things we are told never to question and blindly accept.  How does that not fit into the dichotomy of believing anything and everything or build trust in who to belive?\n",

Blah blah blah?\"\n\nWhat Andrew forgets to ask - because he only wants to paint one side of the story - is:\n\n- How many of the protesters were actual \"extremists\" as he portrayed them last week versus just everyday people tired of the pandemic and tired of being told what to do by a clueless government?\n\n- How many of the peaceful protesters were emboldened to stay longer because of the PM's divisive and slanderous rhetoric?\"\n\nMy favourite dissonant moment for the media in this whole sordid affair came yesterday, when CBC reporter Ashley Burke and her crew got stuck in a ditch near Arnprior, as they were checking in on a trucker's camp in the area. A protester named Tyson Garneau, sporting a \"Defund the CBC\" hat of all things, pulled them out. Oh, what glorious irony! Google it.\n\nAndrew, stop trying to make like all the protesters are troglodytes. Be part of the solution, not the problem.\n",

They simply can’t live without their electronic access point. Learning and reading requires effort; we, the parents, have ourselves become addicted to this intellectual laziness. So it is not surprising that a significant portion of the population, and not just baby boomers, are taken in by opinions which conveniently place the blame for the societal ills of the moment on convenient scapegoats. And desperate politicians with an agenda otherwise not particularly attractive will use those opinions to sway voters and force their way in. Rule by mob becomes a distinct possibility in that context. ",

The latter know exactly what they are doing. They know that they are spreading falsehoods, validating lunacy, crossing lines previously considered uncrossable. They just no longer care.\"\n\nThere are very very large chunks of \"shared reality\", as believed in by Mr. Coyne, that are in fact \"outrageous lies\".  Copernicus and Galileo described a relaity that the Earth orbitted the sun - the Church described this as an outrageous lie.  Human history is a long process of objective truth being shown as an outrageous lie.  It is ridiculous to assume that the lazy assumptions of what is \"objective truth\" are in fact accurate and that the sweep of human history has stopped.  WE ALL BELIEVE THINGS THAT OUR DESCENDANTS WILL CONSIDER INSANE, as the defination of reality keeps changing with time.",

Yes, there are degrees of efficacy and there continue to be cases of adverse reactions, some of them very severe. But overall, the societal benefits are clear.\n\nOur ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting GHGs are also beyond dispute. The ability of GHGs to destabilize weather patterns & alter climatic conditions is now accepted as a reality by almost all credible experts and by all governments. \n\nGiven the minimal sacrifices & risks involved in getting vaccinated, it's a no-brainer.\n\nThe sacrifices & risks involved with climate change, however, are orders of magnitude greater.\nMy fear is that, given the backlash against public health measures by a very disruptive minority, it seems impossible that humanity can \"get it together\" to effectively reduce GHG emissions.\n\nCollectively, we are our own worst enemy, primarily because of those who subvert the efforts of the sensible, civic-minded majority.",

CPC members were scrabbling to fill in a few seats behind that speaker so it looked like there was someone in attendance at this very critical time in the history of Canada. I know there were at least five Conservatives in the House. I can only imagine how many Liberals showed up. How many was it anyway MSM people? Then guess what, after virtually no major discussion on the ramifications of the Emergency Act implementation it was approved then shortly thereafter rescinded. Rescinded after the damage was done not only to Canadians trust in our parliamentary process, but law enforcement and our banking system. International news media like the Economist, once supportive, took to slamming Ottawa. Canada's MSM needs to start doing its job before Canada as a nation moves into the neverland of \"fringe\" democracies ushered on its way by \"so called\" MSM.
