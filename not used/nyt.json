                "commentBody": "\"... some fret that his obsession with false claims about the 2020 election could cost the G.O.P. in 2022.\"\n\nThere is obviously a torturous strategy behind Trump's new statements, and they should not be explained away by linking them to one of his many obsessions. Trump knows quite well that any genuine investigation into the 2020 election will prove his claims to be bogus.  So, he has other reasons to say things such as: republicans should not be voting in 2022 and 2024 elections \"If we don’t solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020”.\n\nThe simple fact is the GOP politicians by now have realized that Trump is unable to win another election. They know all young voters and the majority of women in the US, irrespective of their political affiliations, will be voting against him. That is where Biden got his 81 million popular votes in the last election and, if Trump runs in 2024, Democrats can count on their votes again.\n\nSo the GOP has now a simple plan: Use Trump and his base to win the 2022 elections and then, well before the 2024 presidential election, dump him.\n\nThere is only one problem with that plan: it underestimates Trump.  Trump has already got a whiff of what GOP leadership is trying to do and is actively countering it.\n\nTrump is now discouraging his base from voting in 2022 and 2024 to force GOP's leadership hand.  Clearly, after they turned on him on Jan. 7, albeit momentarily, Trump has stopped trusting them.  Remember: Trump, the forgotten man, never forgets.",

So they've been manufacturing doubt in their base and using it to destroy lack of confidence in our election systems.\n\nThis sickness was likely one reason that Trump figured he'd be able to take over that party instead of the Democrats, when he finally decided to run. And before he was even the GOP 2016 choice, he piled on with spreading lies that the only way a polarizing TV personality and showman could lose would be if it was somehow rigged against him.\n\nMy advice to Republicans who believe the lies?  Ask yourself why you are so willing to believe things with no evidence to support your faith.\n\nAsk also why your party leaders and your major media sources are happily spreading lies to destroy faith in election processes - and doing so despite the findings of deeply-conservative Republican election officials, Trump-appointed judges, and others who presumably are interested in seeing that their candidates are seeing fair elections and their candidates find out what all voters think.\n\nYou are being told you should doubt fellow Republicans when they report honestly that our elections are fair.

Year after year, he’s alienated supporters along with everyone else. In 2020, Trump lost the presidency, the senate, and the house for the Republican Party, \n\nSince then, his supporters have become evermore extreme and violent, attempting - after his encouragement - to overthrow the government on January 6th and continuing to this day to threaten American democracy by discrediting and opposing free and fair elections. \n\nWhen we talk about Trump as the continuing leader of the Republican Party, we aren’t talking about the next election, we’re talking about a violent, authoritarian revolution. Trump has no interest in elections, by the numbers, he’s lost every one and until we face the fact, openly and honesty, we as a country, are in danger.",

But that doesn't matter if the HOUSE is made of the proverbial cards.  Republican elections can now be won because they say so, rather than through evidence. In fact no one needs to vote. The Red states will call their election outcomes as they see it regardless of the real votes; if such exists. This is where they are going and some Republicans are beginning to see the light. It is hard to agree with such dramatic falsehoods when there is no supporting evidence for such claims. That is where Trump is hanging out and it may be a bitter pill to take for some Republican voters.",

And the rest of us are powerless to stop them. I think lots of Republicans will be voting in 2022 and 2024, either despite or because of TFG, mainly because they are loving their new maps and know they will easily beat any Democrat, thanks to the power of gerrymandering.",

Elect all the election officials he can to ensure Republicans (Trump) will always \"win\" no matter how many votes they get.  It is not an exaggeration to say our very democracy is at stake in the upcoming midterms.   Most establishment Republicans support him and these tactics because at a fundamental level they know they can't win fair and square because their ceiling in the popular vote seems stuck at 47%.",

When I'd go home and spend time around family and friends, there were more than a few who had never voted in any election prior to trump but enthusiastically supported him with their vote and their wallet. He was a singular, uniquely energizing figure. There were a significant number of voters who were swept up into the carnival show that was his campaign, and policy or impact on their lives mattered less than the way he made them \"feel.\"\n\nHis presence is a double edged sword for the GOP. On the one hand there are a significant number of voters who could care less about a junior congressman from their local district who is running in 2022, and won't be compelled to vote if trump isn't part of the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, moderate R's - who may have voted D or sat out in 2020 - aren't going to go all in on a candidate who embraces trump's support.\n\nRepublicans will make choices based on their district as to how much they bow down to him. Someone in a deep red area will fully embrace him, and someone in a competitive area will try to keep one foot in, one foot out. But no serious GOP candidate can completely disavow trump, because his supporters in every district constitute too large a group to leave on the table.\n\nFor better or worse, as long as trump is alive, it is no longer the party of Regan or Lincoln. It's the party of donald.",

Who knew a man who actually contributed money to Mrs. Clinton's early political campaigns as a Democrat would get to this level.  Now the GOP has turned into a chaos of COVID superspreader events, cheating, and outright criminality while the Dems are forming circular firing squads over inappropriate behavior decades prior in frat house parties and unfortunate utterances on Twitter.",

Vaccines and masks infringe on freedom, there is no climate change so he withdrew from the Paris accords, and now whine incessantly about the big steal.\n\nIt's all he has. And while, as a golden calf, his solid base continues to cheer, he can't help but be antagonizing small percentages of his base who have real problems.\n\nRepublicans who are worried realize that Biden won key states with a few percent of the vote. Trump will continue to lose a percent or two of the vote here and there in key areas with his whining about 2020. But he has nothing in policy to offer. Republicans could lose a lot of seats in Congress, not by a landslide but who cares; a win is a win.",

Until Trump, American politicians used to concede when they were outvoted and then make whatever adjustments might be needed to win the next round.  That’s how democracy works. Trump prefers to lie, cheat, and undermine the Constitution.  It is truly scary to see how easily he transformed the GOP, the party of my parents who were Eisenhower Republicans, into an authoritarian personality cult in which even conservatives who are honest and independent-minded no longer have a place.  In their current form the Trump Republicans have no hope of winning a majority of votes in a fair and free national election, so they are doing everything they can to prevent the 2024 election from being fair or free.  It’s really quite simple; claim that the fair and free 2020 election was actually stolen, and then use that as an excuse to set the stage for overturning the results in 2024.  It seems likely that we will see one or more Republican state legislatures in 2024 overturning a Democratic majority vote on the basis of legislation they passed in the aftermath of the Trumpster lies about 2020.",

(Not the coup he actually plotted and tried to pull off.)\n\nAs a Republican Inspector of Elections for my township, I faced many angry voters who were convinced that we must be rigging the election in 2016, when Hillary carried our precinct, and many more in 2020. For my precinct I  am sure they were wrong. \n\nThe reason we have religious freedom is so that you can believe what you want about God(s). But it is not freedom if I have to believe it too. In earthly affairs like elections, belief does not matter legally. What matters is evidence, ballots, and the right of you, me, and our fellow Americans to vote.",

Bannon has been ordered to appear and defied the order but the committee is not backing down.\n\nRepublicans are not a monolithic group. Most of us are NOT gun slinging, COVID spreading, mad dogs who advocate insurrection. Republican Teddy Roosevelt created more national parks than any president, and Republican President Eisenhower created the national highway system after saving the world from the Nazis.\n\nRepublicans have a long and storied history despite the 50 current republican senators who cower in front of Trump. My prediction is Biden's agenda will advance as Trump's grasp on the uninformed wanes. Sooner or later two republican senators will join their democratic counterparts and pass desperately need Climate Change legislation.\n\nOur credibility as a responsible party needs to shed the albatross known as Trump.",

There has been ZERO accountability for his attempts to overthrow democracy and yet, the GOP still backs him 99% of the way with the exception of reps like Kinzinger and Cheney. While some like McConnell might gripe about Trump behind his back, they gladly accepted his cult money and installed all of his cronies to SCOTUS and other appointments. \n\nThe truth is, he's shown them there's a way to \"win\" without really winning through elections and they love every bit of it. They can wring their hands and say it's not them but it's the only way they can survive.",

Trump is unbalanced and wants to be worshipped. The moral fiber of the GOP is nonexistent when they can stand behind someone who is responsible for the attack on the Capital. Trump is a crook so those in congress that support this insane man are cowards. They are only looking out for themselves. What did Trump accomplish in his four years ? He tried and is still trying to destroy democracy and he is getting help from the GOP . GREED is running the GOP.",

The world is too complex for a man with such a small mind and huge ego. He’s shown himself willing to destroy freedom in order to keep himself in power. Those who enable him will be shown to be as destructive to this republic as any southern politician/radical/rebel prior to the Civil War. He is intent on destruction. We must destroy his ability to tear down our country. Let him go live in Russia, where he apparently has deep roots. And his despicable children can all go with him.

But, somehow the GOP turned a blind eye to Trump's lifelong record of failures,  bankruptcies, and the  destruction, chaos, and casualties that follow in his wake. \n\nAlmost everyone who gets involved with Trump sooner or later ends up toxic and as damaged goods. Yet, Trump somehow manages to skate away to his next narcissistic disaster of his own making. \n\nIt wasn't hard to see that the Republican Party was becoming ever narrower, consumed with ideological right-wing purity and Trump. \n\nSo the party chased the moderates from its ranks and spent all its time bashing the Democrats rather than governing and getting anything constructive done for the country and its people. \n\nTrump and his minions have given the GOP an ultimatum: Crown Trump king or dictator and reject any form of democracy for authoritarian rule--or the Republican Party (such as it is) will lose the 2024 election. \n\nBall is in your court GOP.

It is the single most important thing for Republicans to do.”\n\nWell, he actually did document allegations of voter fraud.\n\nHe did this in his speech on January 6th. He made around 50 allegations of voter fraud that happened in six states, like illegal voting by dead people, underage people, non-citizens, and out-of-state people. \n\nBut he has never provided evidence supporting these allegations. No names of the illegal voters. \n\nSo, how are Republicans supposed to solve this alleged voter fraud without the detailed evidence of it from him?\n\nSurely, he must have the evidence, like the names of those illegal voters, in order to make his allegations. \n\nSo, why hasn’t he revealed this critical information, which is needed to solve his alleged instances of voter fraud.\n\nRepublicans really need the details from him, to figure out how his allegations happened.\n\nMaybe Herschel Walker can get the evidence from Trump about the allegations dealing with Georgia. Like the names of the over 10,300 dead people who voted in Georgia.",

And one of those parties and their support base, the Republican one, has become intoxicated by the emotional force of a narcissist who will never accept defeat and is out to destroy American democracy. Donald Trump presents in every way the stereotypical totalitarian leader with some unique additions to that product brand. With Donald Trump we get added to that descriptor the ingredients of psychological dysfunction, impulsiveness and deficient intellect. As tellingly described in Mary Trump’s book of what life was like growing up a Trump, Trump’s father Fred beat into his son Donny’s head to never accept defeat. Being labeled a loser the worst condemnation. It’s what Donald Trump himself adopted as a life long creed to live by. To fully absorb the immediate threat he and his Republican enablers present to America it demands the type of recognition and examination leading to question every  American needs to ask themselves: “The election to the Presidency in 2016 of Donald Trump, an individual so deficient, damaged and damage making. How did that happen? What does it tell us about America as a nation and its people?”",

Without any filters or understanding of (or even concern, and even disdain, for) how politics actually works, he has undermined himself in so many ways - and will likely continue to do so.  And his malignant narcissism - and its underlying sociopathy - only exacerbates this.\n\nHe is already well on the way to creating a situation in which the midterms will NOT lead to a loss by the Party currently in power - despite all of the GOP efforts to create a permanent \"minority rule.\"\n\nBy continuing to sell the Big Lie - and undermining the entire credibility of elections - he is only causing his own base, and GOP voters in general, to question whether their vote counts.  And now he has openly suggested that GOPers not vote AT ALL because ALL elections are \"rigged\" - \"particularly\" the upcoming ones.  If his base and GOP voters in general follow his lead, the Dems SHOULD have a cakewalk into not only holding their own in 2022, but possibly even ADDING seats in both the House and Senate, thus solidifying their political position.  (Of course, we also know that the Dems are famous for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory...)\n\nIf that happens, 2024 is anyone's guess - but the Dems would have a leg up.\n\nLet Trump be Trump, since he may well be the Dems' \"best friend\" at this point, going SO overboard in his narcissistic grievance and hubris that he could easily hand 2022 to them.",

Now the party is saddled with the guy who cost them the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. He is the cancer that has metastasized throughout the party. So the GOP is facing a dilemma: fracture internally and lose the next election or coalesce behind Trump and lose the next election.\n\nGiven the events that have transpired since Trump lost by over seven million votes, it's hard to see where he and his party could pick up additional support. Republicans are tethered to a man with no moral compass nor policy direction. What do they plan to offer an America that now knows what another term of 45 might bring?\n\nTrump's supporters may be a solid majority within the GOP, but the party itself is a minority. The Party of Trump simply cannot generate the numbers to needed to retake the government. This is not a formula that will bring success in national elections.\n\nFor this we should consider ourselves lucky.",

The elimination of the now-fully-corrupted Republican Party from federal power is absolutely necessary to heal the disruptive divisions of the US. Right after victory, the top priority must go to an effective voting-rights law that destroys the chances of GOP vote cheating at the state level. This is more urgent than climate change or even the economy. There will be plenty of opportunity and time after 2022 for Democrats to argue about their ideals. There are no ideals without the power to bring them to reality.",
